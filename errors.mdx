# Error Handling

LedgerBeam uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general: Codes in the 2xx range indicate success. Codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, a request failed, etc.). Codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with LedgerBeam's servers (these are rare).

| Code                                   | Description                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **200 - OK**                           | Everything worked as expected.                                                                              |
| **400 - Bad Request**                  | The request was unacceptable, often due to missing a required parameter.                                    |
| **401 - Unauthorized**                 | No valid API key was provided.                                                                              |
| **402 - Request Failed**               | The parameters were valid but the request failed.                                                           |
| **403 - Forbidden**                    | The API key doesn't have permission to perform the request.                                                 |
| **404 - Not Found**                    | The requested resource doesn't exist.                                                                       |
| **409 - Conflict**                     | The request conflicts with another request.                                                                 |
| **429 - Too Many Requests**            | Too many requests hit the API too quickly. We recommend an exponential backoff of your requests.            |
| **500, 502, 503, 504 - Server Errors** | Something went wrong on LedgerBeam's end. These are rare and if they happen, please contact us immediately. |

## Error Response Format

LedgerBeam uses two types of error response formats:

### Field Validation Errors

When validation fails for specific fields:

```json
{
    "error": {
        "field_name": [
            "This field is required"
        ]
    }
}
```

### General Errors

For authentication and other general errors:

```json
{
    "error": "Unauthorized access"
}
```

## Common Error Scenarios

### Missing Required Field

```json
{
    "error": {
        "field_name": [
            "This field is required"
        ]
    }
}
```

### Unauthorized Access

```json
{
    "error": "Unauthorized access"
}
```

### Invalid API Key

```json
{
    "error": "Invalid API key"
}
```

## Best Practices

- **Handle 429 errors gracefully** - Implement exponential backoff when you receive rate limit errors
- **Validate input data** - Check your request parameters before sending to avoid 400 errors
- **Keep API keys secure** - Ensure your API key is valid and has the necessary permissions
- **Monitor for 5xx errors** - Contact support immediately if you encounter server errors
