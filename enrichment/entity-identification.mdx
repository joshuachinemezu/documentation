Entity identification serves as the foundation of transaction enrichment. It detects entities within transaction descriptions and categorizes them based on their **role** in the transaction and **type**. All identified entities are accessible through our [Entities API](/entities).

# Transaction Roles

Every transaction involves one or more entities playing specific roles:

- **Account Holder**: The entity whose account is being used for the transaction (may or may not appear in the description)
- **Counterparty**: The other party in the transaction, typically visible in the description, which can be either a `person` or an `organization`
- **Intermediaries**: Payment processors, delivery services, or other companies that facilitate the transaction on behalf of the account holder

# Resolving Account Holder Ambiguity

Certain transactions contain information about both the account holder and counterparty within the same description. These situations are particularly challenging to resolve, especially in `business` transactions where multiple organizations might be mentioned.

Consider this transaction example:

```
PAYPAL *DOORDASH* RESTAURANT SUPPLY CO | REF: 12345 | *********** | *******************
```

From this description, we can identify `PAYPAL`, `DOORDASH`, and `RESTAURANT SUPPLY CO` as entities. Without additional context, it's unclear whether the account holder is the restaurant supply company or if they're the counterparty, while PayPal and DoorDash are clearly intermediaries. Providing the `name` of the [account holder](./account-holders) when available can significantly improve accuracy in such ambiguous cases.
